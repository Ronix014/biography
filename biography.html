        <h3>CHILDHOOD STORY</h3>    
        <p><blockquote>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup><b>1</b></sup> Hello! I’m Jan Aaron P. Amigo, and I’m going to tell you my story. 
            <sup><b>2</b></sup> During my childhood years, I was raised by my grandmother in a small town in Cavite. 
            <sup><b>3</b></sup> The environment was very relaxing and peaceful, being close to nature, surrounded by plenty of trees, and enriched with clean rivers. 
            <sup><b>4</b></sup> You would never get bored going outside for an adventure with friends. 
            <sup><b>5</b></sup> On weekends, we would trespass into the elementary school to fly our homemade kites crafted from plastic bags and broomsticks. 
            <sup><b>6</b></sup> Under the bright afternoon sun, we played in the open fields, boasting about whose kite could soar the highest in the sky. 
            <sup><b>7</b></sup> Sometimes, we would take a long walk down the stairs leading to the river. 
            <sup><b>8</b></sup> Along the way, we would pass by a small creek where we often found little crabs, which my friends would catch and play with. 
            <sup><b>9</b></sup> Afterward, we would swim in the cold river water, laughing and enjoying every moment. 
            <sup><b>10</b></sup> Every January, during the town fiesta, most barangays were busy attaching banderitas, which always caught my eye. 
            <sup><b>11</b></sup> Merchants set up stalls called tiangge near the court, and rolling carts displayed small folded papers where you had to guess what was written inside and place a bet ranging from 1 peso to 5 pesos. 
            <sup><b>12</b></sup> I won only once and got a colored purple chick, but sadly, it died due to the cold weather. 
            <sup><b>13</b></sup> They also sold ducks and colored chicks for around 15-20 pesos, and many kids kept them as pets. I bought a duck instead because they were stronger and could survive the cold. 
            <sup><b>14</b></sup> I managed to raise six of them into adults with large wings and feathers. 
            <sup><b>15</b></sup> There is also a separate field for rides called perya, like the ferris wheel and caterpillar, that I usually rode, and adults played bingo and color games aside. 
            <sup><b>16</b></sup> I miss those times that every time on our way home, my grandmother would buy me a vanilla ice cream coated with different flavors, and she knew those were my favorite. 
            <sup><b>17</b></sup> The simple pleasures of those days, like playing with friends and enjoying my grandmother’s company, are memories I’ll always treasure. 
            <sup><b>18</b></sup> Another activity to do was playing at the covered court, engaging in basketball, running, and hide-and-seek. 
            <sup><b>19</b></sup> Looking back, I think those were the best times of my life before moving to Metro Manila. 
            <sup><b>20</b></sup> Those memories are dear to me, and I carry them wherever I go.

        <h3>TEENAGE STORY</h3>    
        <p><blockquote>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup><b>1</b></sup> Continuing my studies in Grade 4 in Metro Manila was a completely different experience. 
            <sup><b>2</b></sup> The environment, the way people interacted, and even their conversations were new to me, making it difficult to adjust. 
            <sup><b>3</b></sup> Unlike the peaceful and nature-filled surroundings I was used to in Cavite, the city felt busier, noisier, and more crowded. 
            <sup><b>4</b></sup> I missed the fresh air and open spaces where I used to play freely with my friends. 
            <sup><b>5</b></sup> I had to adapt to the fast-paced lifestyle of Manila, where everything seemed to move quicker than what I was accustomed to. 
            <sup><b>6</b></sup> In high school at Ramon Magsaysay Cubao, another chapter of my education began. 
            <sup><b>7</b></sup> I felt pressured because, despite having half-day classes, there were so many subjects to study, and the expectations were high. 
            <sup><b>8</b></sup> The transition was tough at first, but over time, I gradually adjusted to my new environment. 
            <sup><b>9</b></sup> As I grew closer to adolescence and maturity, I learned a lot about dealing with people around me. 
            <sup><b>10</b></sup> I met classmates from different backgrounds and experienced various cultures within the city. 
            <sup><b>11</b></sup> Visiting my classmates' homes opened my eyes to different household situations, and I even visited some poor homes in Quezon City, which made me more appreciative of what I had. 
            <sup><b>12</b></sup> After classes, we would go to internet cafes to play games or visit malls to hang out, which became my new way of spending free time. 
            <sup><b>13</b></sup> However, living in the city felt a bit boring because I couldn’t do the things I enjoyed in Cavite, like swimming in rivers or playing in wide fields. 
            <sup><b>14</b></sup> My interest in computers started to develop during this time because of my frequent visits to internet cafes. 
            <sup><b>15</b></sup> I spent extra money from my allowance just to play games with my friends, and over time, I realized how costly it was to keep doing that regularly. 
            <sup><b>16</b></sup> My dad had his own computer at home, and whenever it built up dust, I would take the time to disassemble and clean it. 
            <sup><b>17</b></sup> I became fascinated with how computers worked and started upgrading it little by little, adding small modifications like LED fans to make it look cooler. 
            <sup><b>18</b></sup> Watching tech YouTubers like Linus Tech Tips and Bitwit fueled my interest even more. 
            <sup><b>19</b></sup> I found myself craving the idea of owning my own personal computer one day. 
            <sup><b>20</b></sup> Whenever I was bored, I would watch tech-related videos, learning about different hardware components and their functions.

        <h3>COLLEGE STORY</h3>    
        <p><blockquote>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup><b>1</b></sup> Entering college marked a fresh start for me, but it also introduced a learning environment unlike anything I'd ever experienced before. 
            <sup><b>2</b></sup> The pace was faster than I imagined, and the weeks seemed to fly by as we transitioned rapidly from one topic to the next. 
            <sup><b>3</b></sup> It was a whirlwind, and at times, it felt like I was barely keeping up with everything. 
            <sup><b>4</b></sup> At the same time, many of my friends from junior high had already graduated and were stepping into the workforce, including my girlfriend. 
            <sup><b>5</b></sup> This created a sense of pressure for me. 
            <sup><b>6</b></sup> I couldn't help but think that while they were already working and beginning their careers, I was just starting my second year of college. 
            <sup><b>7</b></sup> It made me question if I was falling behind, especially as I watched them take on adult responsibilities like paying bills, managing their time, and carving out their own paths. 
            <sup><b>8</b></sup> However, as much as I felt that pressure, many of my friends advised me to enjoy my college days instead of rushing to work. 
            <sup><b>9</b></sup> They shared that adulting wasn't as glamorous as it seemed. 
            <sup><b>10</b></sup> They spoke about the daily grind of working to earn money just to cover expenses, how exhausting it could be, and how sometimes, you didn't have the time or energy to fully enjoy life. 
            <sup><b>11</b></sup> Their advice was a reminder to savor the time I had in college, a time to learn, grow, and explore before stepping fully into the responsibilities of adulthood. 
            <sup><b>12</b></sup> Whenever I found myself uncertain about the future, I turned to them for advice on what to expect when it came to work and adult responsibilities. 
            <sup><b>13</b></sup> They offered insights on how to balance work and life, and how to prepare for the challenges that lay ahead. 
            <sup><b>14</b></sup> I realized that while college was important for building the foundation of my future, it was also crucial to take time to enjoy the process, make memories, and build skills that would serve me in the long run. 
            <sup><b>15</b></sup> With two more years left in my college journey, I'm determined to make the most of it. 
            <sup><b>16</b></sup> I want to graduate with not just a degree, but with experiences that shape who I am and prepare me for the future. 
            <sup><b>17</b></sup> I aim to hone my skills, discover new passions, and ultimately find my own path toward a successful career. 
            <sup><b>18</b></sup> Though the journey may have its challenges, I’m committed to navigating them with a focus on growth, both academically and personally. 
            <sup><b>19</b></sup> So that when the time comes to enter the workforce, I'll be ready for the opportunities and responsibilities that await. 
            <sup><b>20</b></sup> College is a time of both self-discovery and preparation, and I’m excited for what the future holds.
